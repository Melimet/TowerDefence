# User manual
It is recommended to clone the whole repo and then running it through an IDE. Jar file doesnt really work. Oracle's Java 8 should work fine.

## Start menu

When the program starts, this menu pops up. It has two fields and a start button in it.
- Map's filename is quite self explanatory. You can create your own maps by creating a .txt file and dumping it in the resources folder of the project. The first row is reserved for the map's name and then afterwards on each row x and y coordinates are meant to be written, separated by a comma.
- Invader hp percentage changes the difficulty of the game. It is a multiplier for invader hitpoints.
- Start game button starts the game and switches to the game window.

## Game window

After pressing start game button, this window pops up. You can build towers on tiles that are green and are unoccupied. Building is done by clicking on a tile. You can build type 2 towers by selecting type 2 towers on the bottom of the window and then clicking a tile. Make sure you have enough gold to build a tower!

Waves are started by pressing the start wave button. Wave ends after all invaders are dead or player runs out of lives.
